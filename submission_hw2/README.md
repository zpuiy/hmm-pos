# Instruction for code.py
To successfully execute the code.py python file, the json, numpy, and copy packages need to be installed.

## loading data
The script contains hardcoded paths to read the training, testing, and development data located within a folder named 'data'. To modify the paths according to your needs, simply alter the values assigned to path_train for training data, path_dev for development data, and path_test for test data.

## reproducing output
The script also contains hardcoded paths to output the files vocab.txt, hmm.json, greedy.json, and viterbi.json to a folder named 'out'. If you wish to change the output directory, adjust the values for path_vocab for vocab.txt, path_hmm for hmm.json, path_greedy for greedy.json, and path_viterbi for viterbi.json to your desired paths.
